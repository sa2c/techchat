title: "Staying sane in Python with virtual environments"
speaker: Ed Bennett
date: 2018-06-15
abstract: |
  One of Python's most attractive features and the source of much of its power  is its extensive library of 
  third-party modules and libraries. However, when too many libraries are installed, it becomes difficult to
  manage keeping compatible versions, and to move applications between machines. In this Tech Chat, Ed will 
  introduce some of the tooling available to make these experiences easier, including conda, virtualenv, and 
  pipenv.
