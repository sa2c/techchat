abstract: |
  The talk will introduce and motivate several design features of current chips and operating system features. 
  These include an accessible introduction to features of many modern processing units, such as: CPU caches, 
  pipelining, superscalarity, branch prediction and speculative execution. Only a very basic familiarity with 
  common programming concepts is assumed. The interplay between these chip design choices which resulted in the recent, 
  highly-publicised Meltdown vulnerability in almost all recent Intel chips will be explained at high level, without assuming 
  knowledge of any specific language.
