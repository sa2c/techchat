  What do you do when your Python projects become too large to manage 
  by simply sticking a bunch of Python files in a folder? How can you 
  nest packages to best make your code maintainable and reusable?
  In this talk I will discuss some best practices and strategies to
  structuring large projects, drawing from case studies in the Python
  standard library.
