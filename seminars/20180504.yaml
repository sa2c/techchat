title: "Spellcheck for Code, or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the linter"

  Background compilation, incremental compilation, on-the-fly syntax checking,
  or "red squiggles in your editor" have been available for almost two decades,
  but are still sadly underused by many developers, in particular those who do
  not use an IDE where they are enabled by default. In this Tech Chat, I will
  briefly outline the history of the red squiggle, show how you can get them in
  your editor, and try to convince you that it is something you want to do.
