title: "Unsupervised Machine Learning: Aspects of clustering algorithms"
speaker: Michele Mesiti

abstract: |
  Clustering algorithms (CA) are a part of machine learning, and are an
  essential tool for data mining. 
  Some general-purpose CA are readily available in open source libraries, like 
  scikit-learn for python, while other ad-hoc algorithm have to be coded from 
  scratch. 
  In this Tech Chat a number of CA from the scikit-learn Python library 
  will be briefly reviewed, with some simple applications to econometrics. 
  For the rest of the talk we will focus on a specific algorithm for 
  trajectory-based clustering, describing the motivation framework and 
  highlighting the most important implementation details and challenges.
