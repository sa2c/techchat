speaker: Tadas Nikonovas

abstract: |
  The talk will showcase a powerful but little known Linux utility,
  strace. The command belongs to a special group of tools which operate
  on other commands or executables. It reports system calls made and
  signals received by the application under scrutiny and is useful
  for debugging, trouble shooting, or analysing activity of a program
  without available source code. The presentation will focus on a
  particular use case for exploiting strace for tracing I/O activity.
  Basic usage examples of strace will be shown, demonstrating how to
  make sense of the output given by the command.
