abstract: |
  In this talk I will give a thorough introduction to templates in C++.
  This will include topics such as: what a template is; what kind of
  templates are there; what are the rules for template lookup; when are
  templates instantiated, and how can you affect this; what is a template
  specialisation, and what are the restrictions. If time permits we will
  also talk about the "recently" introduced concept of variadic templates
  and how these can be used to replace C's infamous varargs.
  <br /><br />
  The talk is intended to both introduce the rules of templates to the
  audience, push the "all errors at compile time"-mindset, as well as
  build a solid foundation on which we will base the next talk in the
  series, which is on template metaprogramming.
