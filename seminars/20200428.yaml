  When working with a supercomputing cluster it can be frustrating at times to 
  have to wait for your job to start. The system responsible for this works 
  according to a small set of rules that can hopefully be explained in a short 
  tech chat like this. We are going to focus on the algorithm used by the SLURM 
  workload manager (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) for scheduling 
  jobs and discuss the factors in the priority formula, the backfill passes, and 
  the tools that can help us understanding what is going on.
