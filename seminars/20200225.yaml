title: "Multiprocessing and Threading: Going beyond 1 core in Python"
speaker: Ben Thorpe
date: 2020-02-25
abstract: |
  As high-performance computing has evolved over the last few decades
  single-core CPU performance has remained fairly flat as Moreâ€™s law
  has essentially reached its limit. Instead, the emphasis has been
  placed on parallel computing with many modern machines making use
  of four or more CPU cores working on problems in parallel to achieve
  significant speed-up for certain tasks.

  In this SA2C Tech chat, we will cover using the multiprocessing and
  Threading modules for writing parallel programs using the Python
  programing language. We will briefly discuss the pros and cons of
  this approach along with some examples of the various methods provided
  by these modules and some tips/things to look out for when using them.

  A basic understanding of programming in Python is all that is necessary.
  If you have attended our one-day workshop on Software Carpentry you
  should be well equipped to follow along and this will be a useful talk
  for taking your Python/software skills further.
