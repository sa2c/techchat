  Typical usage of HPC involves logging into a remote shell and invoking commands to manage jobs.
  Whilst convenient and powerful, this can be daunting to newcomers. We present a new, open-source 
  tool which enables developers to quickly and easily configure powerful graphical user interfaces 
  suitable for non-technical users. This is achieved flexibly by adapting simple Python classes. 
  The workflow of a HPC job often requires graphical user interactions on desktop machines, for 
  example interactive job setup or visualisation of results. This tool allows these interactions 
  to be streamlined and easily managed by non-technical users in a few mouse clicks. Jobs can also 
  be submitted transparently to multiple HPC systems with different queuing systems.
