  Graphical Processing Units (GPU) are frequently used to solve computationally intensive problems. 
  They are well suited for computationally intensive problems, such as machine learning, but the power 
  comes with limitations. I will give an overview of the history and the technical details of modern GPUs 
  and contrast them with other computing platforms.
