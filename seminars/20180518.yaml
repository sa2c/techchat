  The compiler used to turn human readable code into a machine readable object file 
  naturally has an effect on performance. We usually remember to tune compiler flags 
  to fit the application, but the different compiler versions can behave differently. 
  I study the performance of a well tuned HPC application when compiled with different 
  versions of gcc, clang and the Intel compiler.
