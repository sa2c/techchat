  Continuing on the theme of Machine Learning, I will give a brief 
  technical introduction to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning. 
  Starting from the simple artificial neuron, I will describe the general 
  construction of classifiers, generative models and recurrent neural 
  networks, as well as training the networks using Gradient Descent 
  Algorithms.
