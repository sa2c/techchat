title: "To MVC or not to MVC?"

abstract: |
  First introduced in the 1970s, the Model-View-Controller and its variations are arguably 
  the the most popular and long-lived design patterns for building modular, maintainable 
  and extensible interactive applications for desktop, web and mobile. We introduce the 
  fundamental concepts necessary to start using the pattern, and outline its strengths 
  and weaknesses. Frameworks which leverage concepts from MVC, such as Qt/PyQt and Rails, 
  will be introduced and the advantages and limitations of MVC design discussed.
