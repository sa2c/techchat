abstract: |
  The Microsoft HoloLens is an self contained augmented reality headset and computer. 
  The College of Science and Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching have invested in 
  a number of devices to explore potential applications to teaching and learning. In 
  this talk I will be sharing my experiences developing prototypes for the HoloLens. 
  I'll focus on the capabilities of the device and the challenges of creating augmented 
  reality experiences in environments you've never seen.
