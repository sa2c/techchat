  Ever wondered how git really works? Where and how does it store it's data and what exactly is being stored? Can we peek into the database at 
  files, commits, branches and directory trees? What information is git storing and how? How is this different from other version control systems?
  We take a peek under the hood to see what and how information is being stored and manipulated in our day-to-day git usage, and how this can leads 
  to being more productive with git.
