  Which open source license should you choose when you publish your scientific code? 
  There are several public software licenses giving slightly different permissions and 
  imposing slightly different restrictions to using your code.  I will introduce the 
  most common options, from a public domain declaration to no license at all, and outline 
  their features and problems for scientific code.
