title: "BSMBench and SOMBRERO: Speed testing supercomputers with physics"

abstract: |
  The performance of supercomputers depends on a number of factors. Many of these are
  characteristics of the machine—for example, the processor speed, the memory bandwidth,
  the interconnect. But equally important are characteristics of the application, and in
  many cases the specific problems that the application is solving. BSMBench and SOMBRERO
  are two benchmark suites, tools used for assessing the performance of a particular problem
  or piece of software on a particular piece of hardware, developed at Swansea University,
  which can assess the performance of supercomputers when running problems in lattice gauge
  theory, and beyond. In this talk, Ed will first introduce the basics of lattice gauge
  theories for the unfamiliar, then introduce the HiRep suite used to simulate these theories
  computationally, and then discuss the approaches taken by the two benchmark suites to
  characterise machines’ performance, and present some characteristic results on various
  supercomputer platforms
