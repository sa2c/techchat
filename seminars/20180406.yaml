title: Aspects of Machine Learning
speaker: Michele Mesiti
date: 2018-04-06
abstract: |
  In this Tech Chat I will discuss foundations and problems in Machine Learning in its three main flavours 
  (supervised, unsupervised and "reinforcement"), in the hope of giving the context for future Tech Chats 
  on more specific areas and techniques. I will also try to give a historical perspective and some examples in 
  order to better illustrate some basic principles, with the aim of sparking discussion and experience sharing 
  in the audience.
