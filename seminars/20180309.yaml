title: Continuous Integration with Jenkins
speaker: Colin Sauze

  I will be talking about Jenkins, a continuous integration
  system with a user friendly web interface. Jenkins automates compiling,
  testing and deploying software and can be a very useful tool for
  improving code quality and preventing bugs from reaching production
  systems. I will show how I used Jenkins to build and test a web portal
  for experiment management at the National Plant Phenomics Centre in
  Aberystwyth. I would also be asking the question of how appropriate
  continuous integration is in research software where developers often
  work alone and the number of users is small.
