title: "What even is the module command?"
speaker: Ed Bennett
date: 2018-07-27
abstract: |
  The module command is frequently provided on HPC systems to give access
  to a wide array of often mutually incompatible software, but sometimes it
  has limitations which seem restrictive or quirky. In this Tech Chat we will
  explore the structure and mechanisms of the underlying implementation of 
  the module command to find the origin of these limitations.
