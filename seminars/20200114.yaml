  The Supercomputing Wales project has as one of its goals increasing
  the public understanding of High-Performance Computing in Wales. 
  To further this ambition, the RSE team at the Swansea Academy of 
  Advanced Computing agreed to run a stand at the Swansea Science 
  Festival 2018. To this end, we assembled a cluster of 16 Raspberry
  Pi single-board computers, and developed software to demonstrate
  some of the principles of parallel computing as well one of as the
  types of problem that the supercomputer in Swansea is used for in
  research. In this talk, first presented at the RSE Conference 2019,
  we will describe the process of designing
  and constructing both the hardware and the software, and some of
  the challenges we encountered along the way, as well as discussing
  how well it works as a scaffold to discussions around parallel
  computing with members of the general public.
