  At this TechChat, we'll take a look at spacemacs, a popular new 
  configuration for the emacs editor. This provides, amongst other things, 
  a near-identical replication of vim within emacs. Seasoned vim users can 
  access unparalleled configurability and extendability of emacs, without 
  the need to learn new keybindings for editing. The configuration is 
  designed to make emacs easily discoverable and make common configurations 
  simple. Vanilla emacs users can have the convenience of simple modular 
  configuration, whilst taking advantage of a powerful modular configuration 
  and switching between vim and emacs style with a single keystroke.
