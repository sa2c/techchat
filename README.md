## Template syntax

Parameters are specified in curly braces, as if they will be passed to
Python's `.format()` (because they will).

### `inner_template.html`

This is iterated over for each event (i.e. each YAML file).

The following names are recognised:

* `id`
* `title`
* `speaker`
* `abstract`
* `date`
* `time`

### `annual_template.html`

This file must be specified by hand; by default a dummy version is used.

The following names are recognised:

* `year`
* `content`

The latter is replaced by the results of applying `inner_template.html`
to each YAML file for the relevant year.

### `outer_template.html`

The main design of the page. Two names are recognised:

* `past`
* `future`

The former is replaced by the results of applying `inner_template.html`
to each YAML file for all future events. The latter is replaced by
the result of applying `annual_template.html` to each year.
